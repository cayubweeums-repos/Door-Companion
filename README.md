## Idea
Implement a facial recognition AI that upon recognition will play a preplanned script out of a set of speakers with the recognized individuals name.
Also, potential bonus implementation is to have the software also ping a personal device with a seperate message not meant for the recognized individual.

## Progress
- Implemented tts
- Crude working facial recognition with an alert engine

## Future Work
- Improve alert engine
- Integrate tts with facial recognition
- Allow for customized replies via tts through email responses
